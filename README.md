# Studio-Ghibli-API-Clone
A RESTful API clone of the Studio Ghibli public API, built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This project replicates key endpoints from the original API and stores data in a custom MongoDB Atlas database. Designed for learning, experimentation, and as a foundation for full-stack applications.
